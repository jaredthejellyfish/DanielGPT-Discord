## Features

- Slash commands for pinging the bot, setting the memory depth, displaying system info, and imagining an image from a prompt
- Uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API to simulate human conversation
- Uses the py-cord library to interact with Discord

## Requirements

- The py-cord python module
- An OpenAI API key
- An Discord API Key
- Memory Depth varibale in your environment.

## Usage

To use the bot, first add the bot to your Discord server. Once it is added, you can use the slash commands to control the bot. The /ping command will check the latency of the bot, the /memd command will set the memory depth, the /info command will display system information, and the /imagine command will generate an image based on a prompt. Aside from that you can simply @ the bot in your messages for it to respond to them.
